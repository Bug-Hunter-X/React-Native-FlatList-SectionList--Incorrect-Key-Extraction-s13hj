In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, an uncommon error occurs if you're not careful with key extraction.  If you use the index as the key, you'll encounter issues when the list items change, leading to incorrect rendering or unexpected behavior. This is especially problematic if you are dynamically adding or removing items from the list.  The error may manifest as items not being rendered correctly or as a failure to update their content after an update to the data.
